# Merlin Agent Dynamic Link Library (DLL)

Merlin is a cross-platform post-exploitation Command & Control server and agent written in Go.
This repository contains the very minimal C code file that is used to compile a Merlin agent into a DLL.

Documentation for Merlin can be found [here](https://merlin-c2.readthedocs.io/en/latest) and specific details for building the DLL can be found on the [DLL Agent](https://merlin-c2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/agent/dll.html) page.

Visit Merlin's [main](https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/merlin) repository and [agent](https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/merlin-agent) repository for additional information.
